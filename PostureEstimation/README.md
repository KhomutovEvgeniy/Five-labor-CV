## Overview

The code in this project is an example and test of using Aruco marker and Gridboard detection in a video stream, then creating board posture (an estimation of 3D space as constructed from a 2D video)

Similarly, the same example is provided for Charuco board detection and posturing.

Camera calibration is required, for an example of that check the calibration examplese in this repository.
