## Overview

This code is a test I did to test out calibrating my camera with Python Aruco's Gridboard. The gridboard was generated using the gridboard generation script detailed in this repository. Please note that only one frame is used for the calibration, and that I prefer the results used in a method such as the chessboard calibration method also detailed in this repository.
