## Overview

The code in this directory is a test camera calibration done on a series of images I captured of a printed out chessboard. You can find the chessboard .pdf I printed in this directory. This camera calibration is required for using Aruco camera posture estimation.
 
It is based off of the OpenCV-Python tutorial here: http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_calib3d/py_calibration/py_calibration.html 
 
The calibration file to be used with posturing is saved to calibration.pckl
